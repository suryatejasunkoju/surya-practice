    // Design Patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems.
    // They provide a way to structure code, making it more reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
    // Design Patterns are guidelines for how to solve a problem in a way that can be reused in many different situations.


    // Design Patterns are categorized into three main types:
    // 1. Creational Design Patterns:
    //Definition:
    // Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
    // They increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.


    // 2. Structural Design Patterns
    //Definition:
    // Structural design patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.
    // They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change.

    // 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
    //Definition:
    // Behavioral design patterns deal with object collaboration and responsibility delegation.
    // They help define how objects interact in a system, focusing on communication between objects.
    // They help make complex control flows manageable and understandable.



    // 1. Creational Design Patterns:
    //    - Singleton Pattern
    //    - Factory Pattern
    //    - Abstract Factory Pattern
    //    - Builder Pattern
    //    - Prototype Pattern
    // 2. Structural Design Patterns:
    //    - Adapter Pattern
    //    - Bridge Pattern
    //    - Composite Pattern
    //    - Decorator Pattern
    //    - Facade Pattern
    //    - Flyweight Pattern
    //    - Proxy Pattern
    // 3. Behavioral Design Patterns:
    //    - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    //    - Command Pattern
    //    - Interpreter Pattern
    //    - Iterator Pattern
    //    - Mediator Pattern
    //    - Memento Pattern
    //    - Observer Pattern
    //    - State Pattern
    //    - Strategy Pattern
    //    - Template Method Pattern
    //    - Visitor Pattern
